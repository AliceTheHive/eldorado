Welcome to El Dorado!

# Installation #

Remove the "example" part of these filenames:
config/database.example.yml
config/deploy.example.rb

... and put in the stuff for your setup.

The Capistrano recipe is an example that works well for Media Temple.

# Setup # 

If you're not importing anything (starting a new site), run this command:
rake db:setup 

If you're importing from a PunBB site (only tested with version 1.2.15) then 
fill in the "import" section of the config/database.yml file and run this command:
rake db:import

# Upgrading #

Home Page: http://almosteffortless.com

Use "rake db:migrate" to upgrade your database from an older version
Use "cap deploy_with_migrations" to upgrade your database and app at the same time using Capistrano

Welcome to El Dorado!

# Installation #

Remove the "example" part of the following filenames and put in the details for your setup:
config/database.example.yml & config/deploy.example.rb

# Setup # 

Required gems: tzinfo - run: "sudo gem install tzinfo" on your computer and your host's.
Requires Edge Rails for the tztime plugin: http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2007/2/2/introducing-tztime

Run this command: "rake db:schema:load" if you're not importing anything (starting a new site).
Note: If you're setting things up on your host, add "RAILS_ENV=production" to the end of rake tasks.

If you're importing from an existing PunBB site (only tested with version 1.2.15), 
fill in the "import" section of config/database.yml and run the command: "rake import:database".
Other available rake tasks include: import:avatars, import:headers, and import:files.

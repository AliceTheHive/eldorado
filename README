# Setup # 

Required gems: tzinfo - run: "sudo gem install tzinfo" on your computer and your host's.
Requires Edge Rails for the tztime plugin: http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2007/2/2/introducing-tztime

If you're not importing anything (starting a new site), run this command: "rake db:schema:load".

NOTE: If you're setting things up on your host, add "RAILS_ENV=production" to the end of rake tasks.

If you're importing from an existing PunBB site (only tested with version 1.2.15), 
fill in the "import" section of config/database.yml and run the command: "rake import:database"
Other available rake tasks include: import:avatars, import:headers, and import:files.

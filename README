Welcome to El Dorado!

# Installation #

Requirements: Rails 2.0 (or greater), and the "tzinfo" gem.

1) Set up config/database.yml and config/deploy.rb according to your setup
2) Run "rake db:schema:load" (see note below) and start your web server
3) Visit your new site, note your temporary password, and log in

NOTE: Rake tasks generally only affect the local "development" database. To install on a public site, 
you would need to run "rake db:schema:load RAILS_ENV=production" on the remote server.

# Importing from a PunBB site (version 1.2.15) #

1) Set up the "import" section of config/database.yml
2) Run "rake import:database" (see note above)
3) Run the other available rake tasks as necessary: import:avatars, import:headers, and import:files

# Upgrading #

Visit http://almosteffortless.com and http://code.google.com/p/eldorado/source for updates and news.
Use "rake db:migrate" to upgrade your database from an older version after new releases.
Use "cap deploy:migrations" to upgrade your database and app at the same time using Capistrano.
